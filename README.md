   - **stdio (Standard I/O)**: For local servers running on the same machine

#### SSE Configuration

If you select SSE transport:
1. Enter the server URL (e.g., `https://mcp.example.com/token/sse`)
2. Click "Add Server"

#### stdio Configuration

If you select stdio transport:
1. Enter the command to execute (e.g., `npx`)
2. Enter the command arguments (e.g., `-y @modelcontextprotocol/server-google-maps`)
