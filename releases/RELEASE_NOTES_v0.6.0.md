## 📊 Data-Driven Accuracy

### Real Usage Analysis:
- Analyzed **1,254 actual Aproject requests** from OpenRouter API
- **Input tokens**: 2,701 average (based on real avg: 2,251 + 20% buffer)
- **Output tokens**: 441 average (based on real avg: 368 + 20% buffer)
- **More accurate projections**: ~$0.003/request vs previous overestimates

### Model Coverage:
- Analysis covers all Aproject-configured models
- Real-time pricing from OpenRouter API
- Cost comparison across 30+ AI models

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### For Developers:
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- New optional tool requires OpenRouter API key in `.env` file
- Scripts are completely separate from main application code

### Environment Setup:
```bash
# Add to your .env file (for developers only)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### New Commands Available:
```bash
# Run pricing analysis
pnpm run pricing:analysis

# Analyze historical data (if you have CSV exports)
python scripts/analyze-openrouter-data.py /path/to/data.csv
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Development Environment:
1. Ensure OpenRouter API key is configured in `.env`
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Run analysis: `pnpm run pricing:analysis`

### Production Considerations:
- Scripts are development-only tools
- No impact on production application
- No new environment variables required for production deployment

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Quick Cost Analysis:
```bash
pnpm run pricing:analysis
```

### Expected Output:
- Detailed pricing table for all models
- Daily/monthly cost estimates
- Most/least expensive model identification
- Price comparison ratios

### Use Cases:
- **Pre-deployment**: Cost planning for new features
- **Model Selection**: Choose optimal models for specific scenarios
- **Budget Planning**: Monthly cost forecasting
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track pricing trends over time

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Automated pricing alerts for significant changes
- Historical pricing trend analysis
- Integration with usage monitoring
- Cost optimization recommendations
