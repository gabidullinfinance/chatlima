# 🚀 Aproject v0.3.0 - SEO & Sitemap Implementation

## 🎯 What's New

### 📍 Dynamic Sitemap Generation
- **New Feature**: Added `/sitemap.xml` route with intelligent content generation
- **Production-Only**: Sitemap is only available on production domain (`chatlima.com`) for security
- **SEO Optimized**: Includes proper XML structure with `lastmod`, `changefreq`, and `priority` attributes
- **Privacy-First**: Excludes private user content (chats, API endpoints, authentication pages)
- **Extensible**: Easy-to-maintain structure for adding future public pages

### 🤖 Enhanced Robots.txt
- **Environment-Aware**: Different rules for production vs development environments
- **Privacy Protection**: Explicitly disallows crawling of user chat content and sensitive endpoints
- **Production Ready**: Allows search engine crawling of public pages while protecting user privacy
- **Development Safe**: Completely disallows crawling in non-production environments

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
