### 🗄️ **Database Enhancements**
- **New `favorite_models` Table**: Secure storage of user favorites with proper foreign key constraints
- **Optimized Indexing**: Efficient queries with proper indexing on `(user_id, model_id)`
- **Data Integrity**: Unique constraints prevent duplicate favorites per user

### 🌐 **API Endpoints**
- **GET `/api/favorites/models`**: Fetch user's favorite models
- **POST `/api/favorites/models`**: Add models to favorites with validation
- **DELETE `/api/favorites/models/[modelId]`**: Remove models from favorites
- **Enhanced Models API**: Includes `isFavorite` status in model responses

### ⚛️ **Frontend Architecture** 
- **New `FavoritesService`**: Centralized service for managing favorite operations
- **Enhanced Model Context**: Extended with favorites state management and toggle functionality
- **Custom `useFavorites` Hook**: Simplified favorites management in components
- **`FavoriteToggle` Component**: Reusable star toggle component with accessibility features

### 🎨 **UI Components**
- **Updated Model Picker**: Added "All" and "Favorites" tabs with smooth transitions
- **Star Icons**: Filled stars for favorites, outlined for non-favorites with hover effects
- **Empty State Handling**: Graceful handling when users have no favorites
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

### 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization**
- **Session Validation**: All favorite operations require valid user authentication
- **User Ownership**: Prevents unauthorized access to other users' favorites
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of model IDs before database operations

### 📊 **Data Protection**
- **Cascade Deletion**: User favorites are automatically cleaned up when accounts are deleted
- **Rate Limiting Ready**: Infrastructure prepared for rate limiting favorite operations
- **Audit Trail**: Proper error logging and debugging capabilities

## 📈 Benefits

### 👥 **User Experience**
- **Faster Model Access**: Quickly find and select frequently used models
- **Personalized Workflow**: Customize the interface to match individual preferences
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Less scrolling and searching through model lists
- **Cross-Session Persistence**: Favorites maintained across browser sessions and devices

### ⚡ **Performance**
- **Optimized Queries**: Efficient database operations with proper indexing
- **Optimistic Updates**: Instant UI feedback reduces perceived latency
- **Caching Strategy**: Client-side state management reduces server requests
- **Debounced Operations**: Prevents excessive API calls during rapid interactions
