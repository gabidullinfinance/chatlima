# 🚀 Aproject v0.23.0 - Enhanced Error Recovery & Model Expansion

## 🎯 What's New
- **New Groq Kimi K2 Model**: Added ultra-fast Groq variant of Moonshot AI's Kimi K2 model for enhanced performance
- **Intelligent Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with automatic recovery mechanisms
- **Enhanced UI Resilience**: Error boundary components with graceful error isolation
- **Real-time Streaming Status**: Visual indicators for chat generation progress with timing information
- **Smart Error Detection**: Automatic detection and recovery from stuck or failed requests

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
- Added `requesty/groq/moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct` model via Groq infrastructure for faster inference
- Implemented comprehensive error boundary system with `ErrorBoundary` components
- Enhanced chat API error handling with provider-specific error parsing
- Added debounced error toast system to prevent UI spam
- Implemented streaming activity monitoring with timeout detection
- Added manual recovery mechanisms for user-initiated chat resets

## 🛡️ Security & Reliability
- Enhanced error message sanitization to prevent information leakage
- Added structured error response system with proper error codes
- Implemented timeout protection for stuck requests (2-minute threshold)
- Added graceful fallback mechanisms for provider failures
- Enhanced request validation and error boundary isolation
