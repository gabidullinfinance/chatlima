## 🔄 Daily Workflow Commands

### Start Working
```bash

git pull origin main  # sync with main
```

### Save Progress

### End of Day

## 🛠️ Branch Management

### Check Status
```bash
git status                    # current status
git branch -a                 # all branches
git log main..HEAD --oneline  # commits unique to branch
```

### Sync with Main
```bash
git pull origin main          # merge main into current branch
# OR
git rebase main              # rebase current branch onto main
```

### Clean Up
```bash
git branch -d feature/old-branch      # delete local branch
git push origin --delete feature/old-branch  # delete remote branch
```

## 🚀 Vercel Deployment Commands

### ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING
**NEVER run Vercel setup while on feature branches!**

### Safe Testing Workflow
```bash
# ✅ Setup project (one-time, on main branch)
git checkout main
vercel link  # Setup only, no deployment

# ✅ Test feature branch safely
git checkout feature/your-branch
vercel deploy  # Always creates preview deployment

# ✅ Production deployment (only when ready)
git checkout main
vercel deploy --prod  # Explicit production deployment
```

### Emergency Commands
```bash
# 🚨 If you accidentally deployed feature branch to production
git checkout main
git stash  # if needed
vercel deploy --prod  # Restore safe production

# Then create proper preview
git checkout feature/your-branch  
git stash pop  # if needed
vercel deploy  # Preview only
```

### Deployment Status
```bash
vercel ls                    # List all deployments
vercel logs --follow        # Monitor deployment logs
vercel inspect [URL]        # Get deployment details
```

## 📝 Commit Message Templates

```bash
# Feature commits
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"
git commit -m "feat(api): implement payment endpoint"

# Bug fixes
git commit -m "fix: resolve credit deduction issue"
