# Feature Branch Creation Workflow

This rule provides a standardized workflow for creating new feature branches in the Aproject project, ensuring consistent naming conventions, proper setup, and clear documentation.

## 🌟 Branch Creation Process

### 1. Pre-Creation Planning
Before creating a new feature branch:
- Define the feature scope and requirements
- Choose an appropriate branch naming convention
- Ensure you're starting from the latest main branch
- Check for any conflicting features in development

### 2. Branch Naming Convention
Use descriptive, kebab-case names that clearly identify the feature:

```bash
# Feature branches (new functionality)
feature/auth-integration
feature/polar-payment-system
feature/chat-history-export
feature/user-dashboard-redesign

# Bug fix branches
fix/credit-deduction-bug
fix/negative-balance-blocking
fix/auth-session-timeout

# Enhancement branches
enhance/ui-accessibility
enhance/performance-optimization
enhance/mobile-responsiveness

# Documentation branches
docs/api-documentation
docs/deployment-guide
docs/user-manual-update
```

### 3. Create and Setup Feature Branch

#### Quick Setup Commands:
```bash
# Ensure you're on main and up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and switch to new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Push the new branch to remote and set upstream
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

#### Alternative Step-by-Step:
```bash
# 1. Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# 2. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 3. Create new branch from main
git branch feature/your-feature-name

# 4. Switch to the new branch
git checkout feature/your-feature-name

# 5. Push to remote and set upstream tracking
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 4. Initial Branch Setup

#### Create Feature Documentation
Create a brief feature plan (optional but recommended):

```bash
# Create a feature plan file (optional)
touch docs/features/your-feature-name.md
```

#### Feature Plan Template:
```markdown
# Feature: [Feature Name]

## 🎯 Overview
Brief description of what this feature does and why it's needed.

## 📋 Requirements
- [ ] Requirement 1
- [ ] Requirement 2
- [ ] Requirement 3

## 🏗️ Implementation Plan
1. Step 1: Component/API design
2. Step 2: Core functionality
3. Step 3: UI/UX implementation
4. Step 4: Testing and validation
5. Step 5: Documentation

## 📁 Files to Modify/Create
- `app/api/new-endpoint/route.ts`
- `components/NewComponent.tsx`
- `lib/new-utility.ts`

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for user workflows

## 📝 Notes
Any additional notes, considerations, or dependencies.
```

### 5. Development Workflow

#### Regular Commits
Follow conventional commit messages:
```bash
# Feature commits
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication middleware"
git commit -m "feat(api): implement payment processing endpoint"

# Fix commits
git commit -m "fix: resolve credit deduction for Google users"
git commit -m "fix(ui): correct mobile navigation alignment"

# Enhancement commits
git commit -m "enhance: improve database query performance"
git commit -m "enhance(ux): add loading states to buttons"

# Documentation commits
git commit -m "docs: add API endpoint documentation"
git commit -m "docs: update deployment instructions"
```

#### Regular Pushes
Push your work regularly to keep the remote branch updated:
```bash
# Push current branch changes
git push

# Or explicitly push to origin
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 6. Keep Branch Updated

#### Sync with Main Regularly
```bash
# Method 1: Merge main into feature branch
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git pull origin main

# Method 2: Rebase feature branch onto main (cleaner history)
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git rebase main

# If conflicts occur during rebase:
# 1. Resolve conflicts in affected files
# 2. Stage resolved files: git add .
# 3. Continue rebase: git rebase --continue
```

### 7. Safe Vercel Deployment Testing

#### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Vercel CLI Safety Rules
**NEVER run Vercel setup commands while on feature branches!**

The Vercel CLI has dangerous behavior during initial setup:
- `--prod=false` flag gets **ignored** during first-time setup
- "Set up and deploy" process defaults to **production deployment**
- This can accidentally deploy untested feature branches to production

#### Safe Deployment Workflow:
```bash
# ❌ DANGEROUS - Don't do this on feature branches
vercel --prod=false  # This can still deploy to production!

# ✅ SAFE - Proper testing workflow
# 1. Setup project on main branch first (one-time only)
git checkout main
vercel link  # Setup only, no deployment

# 2. Switch to feature branch for testing  
git checkout feature/your-feature-name

# 3. Deploy as preview only
vercel deploy  # Always creates preview deployment

# 4. Test thoroughly on preview URL
# 5. Never use --prod unless ready for production release
```

#### Emergency Production Revert:
If you accidentally deploy a feature branch to production:
```bash
# 1. Switch to safe main branch immediately
git checkout main
git stash  # if you have uncommitted changes

# 2. Deploy main to restore production
vercel deploy --prod

# 3. Create proper preview for testing
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git stash pop  # restore changes if stashed
vercel deploy  # Preview only
```

#### Vercel Best Practices:
- **Always use `vercel deploy`** for feature branch testing
- **Only use `vercel deploy --prod`** for production releases
- **Setup projects on main branch** before working on features
- **Test on preview URLs first** before any production deployment
- **Use Git integration** - let Vercel auto-create previews from pushed branches

## 📋 Branch Management Commands

### Useful Git Commands
```bash
# Check current branch and status
git status

# List all branches (local and remote)
git branch -a

# Check branch tracking information
git branch -vv

# See commits unique to your branch
git log main..HEAD --oneline

# See what files have changed
git diff --name-only main

# Stash current work temporarily
git stash
git stash pop  # restore stashed work

# Delete local branch (if no longer needed)
git branch -d feature/branch-name

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/branch-name
```

### Branch Information
```bash
# See commit history for current branch
git log --oneline -10

# See detailed diff with main
git diff main

# Check if branch is ahead/behind main
git status -uno
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Naming Guidelines:
- Use descriptive names that explain the feature
- Keep names concise but clear
- Use kebab-case (hyphens between words)
- Include the type prefix (feature/, fix/, enhance/, docs/)
- Avoid abbreviations that might be unclear

### Development Guidelines:
- Make small, focused commits with clear messages
- Test your changes regularly
- Keep the branch updated with main to avoid large conflicts
- Document complex changes as you go
- Consider creating draft PRs early for feedback

### Project-Specific Considerations:
For Aproject specifically, consider these areas when creating branches:
- **Authentication**: Features related to [auth-schema.ts](mdc:chatlima/auth-schema.ts)
- **API Routes**: New endpoints in [app/api/](mdc:chatlima/app/api)
- **Database**: Changes requiring [drizzle/](mdc:chatlima/drizzle) migrations
- **UI Components**: New components in [components/](mdc:chatlima/components)
- **AI Integration**: Features in [ai/](mdc:chatlima/ai) directory
- **Payment System**: Polar integration features
- **Credit System**: User credit and usage tracking

### File Organization:
- Keep related changes in logical commits
- Update relevant configuration files ([next.config.ts](mdc:chatlima/next.config.ts), [tsconfig.json](mdc:chatlima/tsconfig.json))
- Add new dependencies to [package.json](mdc:chatlima/package.json) as needed
- Update [README.md](mdc:chatlima/README.md) if the feature affects setup or usage

## 🚨 Important Reminders

- Always start from an updated main branch
- Use descriptive branch names that clearly indicate the feature
- Push branches to remote early to enable collaboration
- Keep feature branches focused on a single feature or fix
- Regularly sync with main to avoid integration conflicts
- Document complex features as you develop them
- Consider the impact on existing functionality
- Test thoroughly before requesting reviews
